So Friend I wanted to let you know you can do just about any task with any of the major languages however it is a lot simpler to use certain languages for these tasks however you give up some computing power. For example python is a very easy language to code in however it is a bit slow, you would notice that with longer scripts. So generally learn whichever languages seem to have a lot of job postings. Picking up a language can be rather easy as long as you know coding basics. Look online for simple challenge problems. I can detail some simple coding challenges for you if you would like, just contact me. 

Note the following languages are most popular at this time:
1. Java
2. C
3. C++
4. Python
5. C#
6. R
7. PHP
8. JavaScript
9. Ruby
10. Matlab

Don't bother to try and learn C or C++. It is a very difficult language that you need help from someone who uses it often. Its data structures are very confusing, to explain a pointer and reference is very hard without strong knowledge of programming. However I think Java is a little more challenging of a language for some but I think it is pretty useful. I prefer it because it is not only fast, it handles using different types very well and it has a lot of useful built-in libraries. The other language I am a big fan of is python, it is typically meant for small scripts and it is so easy to bounce between data types because it doesn't have any built in data type declarations(you can read more about this after some google searches).

I wanted to include 5 coding examples they are a mix of java and python. They are used pretty widely in the field because they can do so much.You will notice in those coding examples how easy it is to do simple tasks. The checkerboard python is a very simple script and it demonstrates creating variables and formulas and not hardcoding in values. That formula will work no matter what width height of the image and how big you want the cell. 

Try and notice some of the coding techniques I use, such as not hard coding, recursive and iterative calls. I make notes in every single code file which explains some important details about it. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

One thing to note is that it is okay to use Google. I don't think I know how to code a basic array in any language and I constantly look it up however that is fine. Just generally know the concepts behind them. Know why in java I would use a String List over a String Array or when I would use a HashSet String. I constantly google stuff like "How to make a Java Set" and I normally choose the Stackoverflow.com option and read what they say. It is pretty helpful. Compiling code can tell you what is wrong with your code, try and read through what it is saying and solve it, if you can't google search the error and what has worked for other people.
